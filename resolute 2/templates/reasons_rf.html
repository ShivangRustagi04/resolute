    <h1>Reasons to Choose Random Forest Classifier</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensemble Learning: Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.</li>
        <li>Handles Non-linearity: Random Forest can capture complex non-linear relationships in the data.</li>
        <li>Feature Importance: Random Forest provides a feature importance score, helping to identify which features are most influential in making predictions.</li>
        <li>Robust to Overfitting: Random Forest is less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.</li>
        <li>Works well with Large Datasets: Random Forest can efficiently handle large datasets and high-dimensional feature spaces.</li>
    </ul>
